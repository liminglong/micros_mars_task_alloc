# micros_mars_task_alloc
This is a ROS package, which is used for the mult-task coordination in a robot team. It is based on Multi-Agent theory and is an abstraction of ALLIANCE model in essence. We have develop a prototype by python. The nodelet-based C++ version is in developing.

We provide an instance of multi-robot patrol to show how to develop a multi-robot application by using the ROS package.
